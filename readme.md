[**Installation instructions**](docs/install.md)

## Setup

This plugin is a panel field and to use it you need to add a blueprint field. You also need a field that has a textarea.

```
fields:
  mytext:
    label: My text
    type: textarea
  keywordmap:
    label: Keyword Map
    type: keywordmap
    target: mytext
```

### A field with a textarea

In this case we call our textarea field `mytext` but you can call it anything.

### A field with a `keywordmap` field

Our new field has two required options:

- `type` needs to be `keywordmap`
- `target` needs to be a field that contains a textarea, in this case it's `mytext`.

## Usage

### Add keywords

Click on the top of the field to keyword phrases. Both single and multiple words are allowed in a single keyword phrase.
